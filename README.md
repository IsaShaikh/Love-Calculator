# Love Calculator 💖

A fun Java application that calculates the love percentage between two names! This simple yet entertaining project uses random generation to display a percentage that represents the connection between two individuals. The app features a visually appealing interface powered by **Lottie animations**, making the experience smooth and interactive.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧡 Enter two names to calculate a random love percentage.
- 🎨 Engaging UI designed with Lottie animations.
- 🔄 Instant result generation with each calculation.
- ✨ Lightweight and simple Java project.

## 🎯 Purpose
Although the concept of the app is playful and purely random, the project primarily focuses on demonstrating how to integrate **Lottie animations** into Java applications to enhance user experience and interface design.

`Why Lottie Animations?`

Lottie animations are far superior to GIFs or videos for UI design because they are:

📉 Smaller in size – Lottie files are vector-based and significantly lighter compared to GIFs or videos.

🎨 Scalable without losing quality – Animations stay crisp at any screen resolution.

⚡ Performance-efficient – They render quickly and do not cause lag, providing a smoother user experience.

🔄 Easily customizable – Lottie files can be edited directly or modified dynamically through code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** – Core application logic
- **Lottie** – For interactive and dynamic UI animations
